Engineered a calibrated XGBoost credit-default model (AUC 0.91, KS 0.46) with a full risk-feature pipeline
(DTI, revolving utilization, credit history depth, inquiry velocity), incorporating consumer-lending domain transformations.
• Designed a SHAP-driven interpretability layer satisfying model-governance, explainability, and Responsible
AI requirements, producing borrower-level adverse-action reasoning and sensitivity analyses.
• Integrated a GPT-based underwriting assistant that synthesizes SHAP vectors + credit-policy snippets to generate
regulator-aligned risk narratives, counterfactual credit-improvement pathways, and discrepancy
checks for monitoring model drift.
