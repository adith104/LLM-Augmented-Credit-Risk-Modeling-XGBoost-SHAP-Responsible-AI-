🔍 Credit-Default Risk Modeling Pipeline

Built a calibrated XGBoost credit-default classifier achieving AUC = 0.91 and KS = 0.46, supported by a full risk-feature engineering pipeline (DTI, revolving-utilization, credit-history depth, inquiry-velocity, and other consumer-lending transformations).

Developed a SHAP-based interpretability layer meeting model governance, explainability, and Responsible AI standards. Outputs include borrower-level adverse-action explanations, feature-attribution summaries, and sensitivity analyses.

Integrated a GPT-powered underwriting assistant that combines SHAP vectors with credit-policy snippets to generate:

Regulator-aligned risk narratives

Counterfactual credit-improvement pathways

Discrepancy and drift-monitoring checks
